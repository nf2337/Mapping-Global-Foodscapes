### Welcome 

All the tutorials here supplement your readings and must be completed on a weekly basis. 

Please follow the steps patiently and diligently so you don't run into any errors.

**A note on troubleshooting:** We'll be using QGIS, a free open source software with a very active community of contributors online. If you run into an error, please try to resolve it through googling. While the tutorials will give you a good background on QGIS and the different tools, you are welcome to consult the extensive [QGIS Introduction](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/index.html). 

**Office Hours:** You are strongly encouraged to attend office hours, which will be run like a tech lab session. I can help you run through the tutorials and tutorialing. Otherwise, you are welcome to email me with hiccups along the way, and always remember to include screenshots.
