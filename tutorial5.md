## Tutorial 5: Using Data Collection Apps 

## Objectives: 

The objectives of this session will be to gather our own dataset of mushrooms in Tivoli Bay using the iNaturalist application. [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) is a social network of naturalists, citizen scientists, and biologists built on the concept of mapping and sharing observations of biodiversity across the globe. We will be locating the GPS coordinates of the mushrooms we find, with the help of Dr. Patricia Kaishian, using her class project entiteld "Natural History of Bard College". Later, we will use this data to make a forrager's map of Bard's campus and its peripheries! 

## Setting up an iNaturalist Account: 

On your iPhone, go to the apple store, and download the iNaturalist App. 

Then, open the app and create an account with your Bard email address. 

Finally, open the project page on the app and search for `Natural History of Bard College`. Join the project, and now you are ready for collection.

## Collecting Data Using iNaturalist

While treading the forest, you will find mushrooms. To add a mushroom observation to our collective dataset, go to Observer > Camera and take a photo of the mushroom. You can add multiple photos to each entry. With the help of Dr. Kaishian, try to identify the name of the species, and add it to "what did you see". Note that the app automatically registers your GPS location, provided by Latitude and Logitude coordinates. This will be important for our mapping exercise. Once you are done, click share. 

On the App, under "Me", you can browse and edit your multiple observations. You need to make sure that all the observations have been successfully uploaded to the project so we can download them as a .csv and visualize them on our map!

## Location data as KML file

In addition to our observations, I will also be recording our [MyTracs](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mytracks-the-gps-logger/id358697908), a GPS logger app on the iPhone. This will help us retrace our wondering path through the forest. NOTE: You don't need to download this yourself.
