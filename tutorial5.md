## Tutorial 5: Using Data Collection Apps 

## Objectives: 

The objectives of this session will be to gather our own dataset of mushrooms in Tivoli Bay using the iNaturalist application. iNaturalist is a social network of naturalists, citizen scientists, and biologists built on the concept of mapping and sharing observations of biodiversity across the globe. We will be locating the GPS coordinates of the mushrooms we find, with the help of Dr. Patricia Kaishian, using her class project entiteld "Natural History of Bard College". Later, we will use this data to make a forrager's map of Bard's campus and its peripheries! 

## Setting up an iNaturalist Account: 

On your iPhone, go to the apple store, and download the iNaturalist App. 

Then, open the app and create an account with your Bard email address. 

Finally, open the app and search for `Natural History of Bard College`. Join the app, and now youre ready for collection.
